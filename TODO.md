# To do

## Issues
- ~~When adding into an existing game, mercenaries part of a kingdom already won't have a correlating contract, causing crashing.~~
- ~~As a prisoner, opening kingdom screen causes a crash.~~

## General
- Campaign time should slowly pass during player battles, allowing the possibility of reinforcements.
- There should be no limit to the number of companions, only a maximum amount you can take into battle.
- Armies & Parties should tend to be much larger.
- Battle advantage ??
- Policies tab in the Kingdom UI should be renamed to Decisions. You could view policies as well as current battle strategy, and get an overview of your kingdoms historical performance in battles & wars.
- Ability to war with clans individually in a kingdom, while the player is independent.
- Ability for an NPC clan to become independent to form their own faction with certain conditions.
- Backwards compatibility
- MCM Options: Armies besiege AI, Additional mercenary clans
- Seasonal warfare; Winter should be spent stockpiling and focusing on keeping the economy stable, and warfare should resume in the spring. Very aggressive rulers or commanders may still take the risk that comes with prosecuting a winter war.
- Automatic cohesion maintenance for individual armies, paid by player.
- Fully replenish cohesion of all active armies in the kingdom from the map, paid by player.
- Armies can deteriorate allowing room for nomads and other migrants to proliferate and take over regions ? Similar to the migration of the Visigoths / Huns around the fall of Rome

## Battle Overhaul
- Arrows should pierce through shields in certain conditions, with some damage dealt to the character and the possibility to stagger them.

## Army Overhaul
- Army map overlay needs hotkeys.
- When the leader of an army is changed to the player while the player is a member of that army, the army map overlay breaks and fails to display the army members.
- ~~Parties not yet gathered in the army should not be put in a disorganized state when moved between armies, such as during a leader change or split.~~
- Mercenaries should not be able to manage armies they are a part of, add members to it, etc.

## Mercenary Overhaul
- ~~Add remaining contract time to the Mercenary panel.~~
- Factions should be less inclined to horde troops - especially in peacetime - in order to pay for mercenaries in wartime.
- Mercenaries should not declare wars on factions over time, currently they do for unknown reasons but do not on game start as intended.
- Slider for mercenary clan spawns on game start.
- Ability to form a mercenary company.
- Ability to join a mercenary company.

## Prisoners Overhaul
- Prisoners should disperse back to enemy lord(s) when escaped, set free or ransomed.
- Army & Party leaders should be able to surrender during battle and their party members would automatically rejoin them when dispersed from prison. INFO: This would be separate from OrderWOPower's Surrender Tweaks in that the surrendering would happen DURING a battle, once the other side comes to a realization they cannot win.
