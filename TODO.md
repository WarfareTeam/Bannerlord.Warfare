# To do

## Issues
- When used with Banner Kings, signing a mercenary contract results in a crash. https://report.butr.link/BCDCCA
- Army map overlay needs hotkeys.
- Mercenaries should not be able to manage armies they are a part of, add members to it, etc.
- ~~When adding into an existing game, mercenaries part of a kingdom already won't have a correlating contract, causing crashing.~~
- ~~As a prisoner, opening kingdom screen causes a crash.~~
- ~~When the leader of an army is changed to the player while the player is a member of that army, the army map overlay breaks and fails to display the army members.~~
- ~~Parties not yet gathered in the army should not be put in a disorganized state when moved between armies, such as during a leader change or split.~~


## General
- Campaign time should slowly pass during player battles, allowing the possibility of reinforcements.
- There should be no limit to the number of companions, only a maximum amount you can take into battle.
- Armies & Parties should tend to be much larger.
- Battle advantage ??
- Policies tab in the Kingdom UI should be renamed to Decisions. You could view policies as well as current battle strategy, and get an overview of your kingdoms historical performance in battles & wars.
- Ability to war with clans individually in a kingdom, while the player is independent.
- Ability for an NPC clan to become independent to form their own faction with certain conditions.
- Backwards compatibility
- MCM Options: Armies besiege AI, Additional mercenary clans
- Fully replenish cohesion of all active armies in the kingdom from the map, paid by player.
- Armies can deteriorate allowing room for nomads and other migrants to proliferate and take over regions ? Similar to the migration of the Visigoths / Huns around the fall of Rome
- Improve create army button in the bottom right on the map to make it stick out more.
- The player should be able to earn gold daily by being in an army as a way to bridge the gap between being a mercenary and being a vassal with a fief.
- Parties of clans without fiefs should be treated similarly to mercenary parties by being paid in gold instead of influence to join armies, and be exempt from the 40% party size limitation. These parties could also seek to join an army of their own accord - for less but liveable payment - in order to survive when they are in dire straits.
- Poor clans will take wealth into account when making new parties, preferring to put their resources into one or a few powerful parties rather than many weak ones that will easily be destroyed. They will do this by merging their parties if necessary as well.

## Army Overhaul
- ~~Automatic cohesion maintenance for individual armies, paid by player.~~ Added in 1.0.4
- Detachment parties using clan members as commanders, which you can order to follow you or send to recruit troops.

## Battle Overhaul
- Arrows should pierce through shields in certain conditions, with some damage dealt to the character and the possibility to stagger them.

## Mercenary Overhaul
- Factions should be less inclined to horde troops - especially in peacetime - in order to pay for mercenaries in wartime.
- Mercenaries should not declare wars on factions over time, currently they do for unknown reasons but do not on game start as intended.
- Ability to form a mercenary company.
- Ability to join a mercenary company.
- Automatic mercenary contract renewal.
- Name list for mercenaries.
- ~~Slider for mercenary clan spawns on game start.~~ Added in 1.0.3
- ~~Add remaining contract time to the Mercenary panel.~~ Added in 1.0.3

## Prisoners Overhaul
- Prisoners should disperse back to enemy lord(s) when escaped, set free or ransomed.
- Army & Party leaders should be able to surrender during battle and their party members would automatically rejoin them when dispersed from prison. INFO: This would be separate from OrderWOPower's Surrender Tweaks in that the surrendering would happen DURING a battle, once the other side comes to a realization they cannot win.

## World Overhaul
- War should constrain economies in a more realistic way; Prices in a war-torn areas of the map should have increased prices especially on necessities.
- War should also cause migration, resulting in recruiting difficulty in war-torn areas of the map and surpluses in peaceful ones.
- ~~Seasonal warfare; Winter should be spent stockpiling and focusing on keeping the economy stable, and warfare should resume in the spring. Very aggressive rulers or commanders may still take the risk that comes with prosecuting a winter war.~~ Experimentally added in 1.0.4
